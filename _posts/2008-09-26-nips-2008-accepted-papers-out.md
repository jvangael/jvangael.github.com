Hot from the presses, the full list of NIPS 2008 accepted papers are out. I quickly browsed through the papers and can say I am looking forward to these:

__Cognitive Science__
* _Analyzing human feature learning as nonparametric Bayesian inference_, J. Austerweil, T. Griffiths
* _Depression: an RL formulation and a behavioural test_, Q. Huys, j. vogelstein, P. Dayan
* _Modeling human function learning with Gaussian processes_, T. Griffiths, C. Lucas, J. Williams, M. Kalish
* _Modeling the effects of memory on human online sentence processing with particle filters_, R. Levy, F. Reali, T. Griffiths
__Neuroscience__
* _Characterizing neural dependencies with Poisson copula models_, P. Berkes, F. Wood, J. Pillow
* _Dependent Dirichlet Process Spike Sorting_, J. Gasthaus, F. Wood, D. Gorur, Y. Teh
__Machine Learning__
* _Gates_, T. Minka, J. Winn: the next big thing in graphical models?
* _Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks_, J. Robinson, A. Hartemink
* _Nonparametric Bayesian Learning of Switching Linear Dynamical Systems_, E. Fox, E. Sudderth, M. Jordan, A. Willsky: some of which we've seen at the NPBayes 2008 workshop
* _The Mondrian Process_, D. Roy, Y. Teh: some of which we've seen at the NPBayes 2008 workshop
