Our machine learning group organizes a series called the _Advanced Tutorial Lecture Series on Machine Learning_ where we get to see some amazing researchers talk about recent developments in Machine Learning. [Karsten](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/karsten), a postdoc in our group has been so kind to film all lectures and slowly but surely these videos are finding their way onto [videolectures.net](http://videolectures.net/mlcued08_cambridge/).

Currently on videolectures.net are videos on:
* Applications of Group Theory to Machine Learning by [Risi Kondor](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~risi/); this math heavy lecture was cool in that Risi explained how tools from abstract algebra and harmonic analysis can be used in Machine Learning too,
* Spectral Clustering by [Arik Azran](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~azran); our local spectral methods expert shared his insight into how spectral methods work.

Coming up soon is a lecture by [David MacKay](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/) on error correcting codes and how they can be decoded using local message passing algorithms. David is a very good speaker and his lecture is certainly in my top 5 of excellent machine learning talks.
