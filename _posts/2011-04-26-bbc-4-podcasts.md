I just discovered some really good podcasts from BBC 4 which I think some people here might enjoy.
* [A Brief History of Mathematics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/maths): a discussion about some great mathematicians.
* [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/iot): very general, one-hour discussions with a few experts. I really enjoyed the episode on “Random &amp; Pseudorandom” from January 13.
