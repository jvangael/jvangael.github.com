First of all, happy new 2008 to all readers!

UCI hosts a famous collection of datasets at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). Recently, they have completely updated their webpage and are starting to offer new datasets. This is a great service to the machine learning community, but I would like to see us take this one step further: we should match this repository of datasets with a repository of algorithms. This would not only allow us to compare algorithms, but also get a lot of intuition about the nature of the datasets: a well-understood algorithm that does great on - say - digit classification but performs really poorly on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset teaches us something about the nature of the data. A recent [JMLR paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume8/sonnenburg07a/sonnenburg07a.pdf) calling for more open source machine learning software, mentions a project at the university of Toronto called [Delve](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/) that meant to do exactly this. Unfortunately, the project seems to be dead as of 2003 or so.
