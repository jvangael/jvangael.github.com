Perfect: the website for the next [machine learning summer school](http://mlss08.futurs.inria.fr/) is up and running. It will be organized on Porquerolles Island, right of the coast of France. The confirmed speaker list is still a work in progress but looks promising already:
* Shai Ben-David (University of Waterloo) _Theoretical Foundations of Clustering_
* Stephane Canu (INSA de Rouen) _Introduction to Kernel Methods_
* Manuel Davy (INRIA) _Parametric and Non-parametric Bayesian Learning_
* Pierre Del Moral (Universite de Bordeaux) _On the Foundations and the Applications of i-MCMC Methods_
* Isabelle Guyon (ClopiNet)
* Yann LeCun (New York university) _Supervised and Unsupervised Learning with Energy-Based Models_
* Rich Sutton (University of Alberta) _Reinforcement Learning and Knowledge Representation_
* Patrick Wolfe (Harvard University) _Overcomplete Representations with Incomplete Data: Learning Bayesian Models for Sparsity_

I'll definitely try to apply and hope for the best!
