A new round of [Microsoft Research PhD scholarships](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/global/apply-europe.aspx) is being organized. I’ve enjoyed being on the scholarship for the past two years: it’s been a great opportunity to meet new researchers at Microsoft and other students at the PhD event organized by MSR Cambridge.

For all you upcoming machine learning rock-stars out there: talk to your advisors, they will have to apply for you but you can probably help them a bit!
