We are starting a new machine learning related initiative in Cambridge: the walk-in [Stats Clinic](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/clinic/). The goal of our consulting service is to help applied researchers with their questions in statistics or machine learning. Starting October 21 from 16:30-18:00, we will be in meeting room 5 at the [Centre for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.cam.ac.uk/map/v4/drawmap.cgi?mp=main;xx=1400;yy=560;mt=c;mx=1090;my=513;sx=4;tl=Statistical%20Laboratory;gf=png) every other week.
