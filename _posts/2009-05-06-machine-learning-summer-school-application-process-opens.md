Just to let all of you know that the application process for the summer school has opened. More info [here](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/mlss09/application.htm). The deadline for applications is June 1. The list of [confirmed speakers](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/mlss09/index.html) is pretty amazing if you ask me.

Hopefully I get to meet some of you in September!
