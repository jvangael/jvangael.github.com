[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) is an absolute classic for anyone wanting to do statistics/machine learning/data mining. I read that the second edition was out and debating whether I should spend the money on this new edition. Via [John Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/10/14/elements-of-statistical-learning/) I learned that the book is out on pdf (from their website). DOUBLE WIN: a) Iâ€™ve already paid once and get the upgrade for free, b) I now have a way to electronically search the book.

I also found out today that Koller and Friedman have just released their much anticipated book [Probabilistic Graphical Models](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11886) from MIT press. At a lengthy 1208 pages, this should provide enough reading for a few nights!
