For the people who missed the [Machine Learning Summer School](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/mlss09/) here in Cambridge this year, the video’s are now available at [videolectures.net](http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_cambridge/)! My personal favorites: David MacKay’s Information Theory, David Blei’s Topic Models, Iain Murray’s Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Tom Minka’s Approximate Inference. Enjoy ...
