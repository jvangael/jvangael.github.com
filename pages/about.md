I am the Data Science Director at a London based eCommerce startup called Rangespan. Before joining Rangespan, I was an applied researcher at Microsoft Research.

My background is in computer science and more specifically in machine learning. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge where my advisor was [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/). Before joining the department in Cambridge I spent some time at the University of Wisconsin in Madison for my M.Sc. In a time long gone, I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Leuven.
